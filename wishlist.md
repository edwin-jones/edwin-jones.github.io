# My Wishlist

Hello all, this secret page if for my friends and family who regularly ask me what I need for birthdays, Christmas and more. Unless you want to buy me a gift, you probably want to head back to the [main page...](https://edwinjones.me.uk). **Please note, I'd prefer e-books and digital items to physical ones if possible due to the fact my house is full and can't really fit more stuff in it**.

## Amazon Prime

I order so many things from amazon that I really could do with [Amazon Prime.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazonprime) An amazon gift voucher to go toward this would be very helpful.

## An adjustable bike helmet

I cycle a lot to work so I could do with a proper adjustable bike helmet. I do have one at the moment but it has no adjustment so it's slightly loose when I turn my head sharply.

Try these online stores:

[Decathalon](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/)

## An Ikea marcus chair (grey)
My current office chair is wearing out and it can be a bit uncomfortable when I'm working to use it for extended periods, and it's a faux leather material so it gets sweaty in summer. The [Ikea Markus](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/chairs-stools-benches/office-chairs/markus-swivel-chair-vissle-dark-grey-art-30261152/) is a well reviewed mid range chair that I'd like to try.

Hello all, this secret page is for my friends and family who regularly ask me what I would like for birthdays, Christmas and more. Unless you want to buy me a gift, you probably want to head back to the [main page...](https://edwinjones.me.uk). **Please note, I'd prefer e-books and digital items to physical ones if possible due to the fact my house is full and can't really fit more stuff in it**.

### Amazon Prime

I order so many things from amazon that I really could do with [Amazon Prime.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazonprime) An amazon gift voucher to go toward this would be very helpful.

### An adjustable bike helmet

I cycle a lot to work so I could do with a proper adjustable bike helmet. I do have one at the moment but it has no adjustment so it's slightly loose when I turn my head sharply.

Try these online stores:

### An Ikea marcus chair (grey)
My current office chair is wearing out and it can be a bit uncomfortable when I'm working to use it for extended periods, and it's a faux leather material so it gets sweaty in summer. The [Ikea Markus](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/chairs-stools-benches/office-chairs/markus-swivel-chair-vissle-dark-grey-art-30261152/) is a well reviewed mid range chair that I'd like to try.

### A griffin laptop stand
I have [one of these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B013BNHROE/?coliid=ITQAEAL01ZU3E&colid=2E60OHDYE668M&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) at work and it is very handy when using my laptop to work, it would be good to have one for my home office as well. The silver ones seem to go well with everything

### A proper electric razor

I've been using disposable razors most of my life and I always end up cutting myself at some point. A nice rechargable electric razor from philips or similar would be awesome.

### The latest version of Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud (digital)

I have a paper version of a very out of date version of this book, but I hear it's the best thing to brush up on your mathematics skills which I am always keen to do.

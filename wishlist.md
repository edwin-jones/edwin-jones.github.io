Hello all, this secret page is for my friends and family who regularly ask me what I would like for birthdays, Christmas and more. Unless you want to buy me a gift, you probably want to head back to the [main page...](https://edwinjones.me.uk)

This list is in no particular order.

 *Please note, I'd prefer e-books and digital items to physical ones if possible due to the fact my house is full and can't really fit more stuff in it, I read most things on my Amazon Kindle.*

### A raspberry pi TV hat

I mostly watch IPTV as we don't have a digital TV receiver. [One of these](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-tv-hat) would help us watch normal freeview channels.

### Amazon Prime

I order so many things from amazon that I really could do with [Amazon Prime.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazonprime) An amazon gift voucher to go toward this would be very helpful.

### An adjustable bike helmet

I cycle a lot to work so I could do with a proper adjustable bike helmet. I do have one at the moment but it has no adjustment so it's slightly loose when I turn my head sharply. Ideally I'd like a neon yellow one as this means I don't have to pack as much high-vis clothing when cycling.

Try these online stores:

### Running shoes

My current running shoes are wearing out and are not long for this world. I am a size 11-12 depending on the store. I tend to overpronate as well.

### Running shorts

A good pair of running shorts with pockets would be ace. I'm roughly a 32" waist.

### iPhone SE armband

My current armband is wearing/worn out so I could do with a new one.

### A rechargeable Oral-B toothbrush

I have a battery powered version currently.

### Jeans

My M&S jeans tend to be wearing out far faster than they should so a more
hard wearing pair would be good for cycling and the like.

### Nice shirts (M&S do good ones)

Kim knows the ones I like, I'm a 15" ish collar.

### V neck pullovers (M&S style)
These are really useful for looking smart, but 
my current ones have holes in... Brown/Grey/Navy
are good options.

### A warm jumper
I have one thick jumper for winter and you guessed it,
it's wearing out. Something warm would help me on long cycles.

### A warm ski jacket
I love ski jackets as they tend to be water and wind proof.
My current one is very thin and warn (it's fine with a jumper
under it)

### An ikea markus chair (grey)
My current office chair is wearing out and it can be a bit uncomfortable when I'm working to use it for extended periods, and it's a faux-leather material so it gets sweaty in summer. The [Ikea Markus](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/chairs-stools-benches/office-chairs/markus-swivel-chair-vissle-dark-grey-art-30261152/) is a well reviewed mid-range chair that I'd like to try.

### A griffin laptop stand
I have [one of these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B013BNHROE/?coliid=ITQAEAL01ZU3E&colid=2E60OHDYE668M&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) at work and it is very handy when using my laptop to work, it would be good to have one for my home office as well. The silver ones seem to go well with everything.

### A proper electric razor

A nice rechargeable electric razor from philips or similar would be awesome.

### The latest version of Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud (digital)

I have a paper version of a very out of date version of this book, but I hear it's the best thing to brush up on your mathematics skills which I am always keen to do.

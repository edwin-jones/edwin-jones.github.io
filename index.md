Hi there! My name is Edwin and I'm a professional software engineer with experience
in C#, Python, HTML, Javascript, CSS, SQL, XML, C++ 
and many more acronyms that are too numerous to fit onto one page. I love to
tinker. I originally built this site from scratch in ASP.NET to keep track of my random projects and host my rants. I then moved to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to give it a more up to date feel. You can find the repository I'm using [here.](https://github.com/edwinj85/edwinj85.github.io)

I currently work as a software developer at <a href="http://www.mediatonicgames.com/">Mediatonic,</a> however before that I worked as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.exclaimer.co.uk/">Exclaimer,</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb">Electronic Arts,</a> 
<a href="http://www.premiertaxfree.com/">Premier Tax Free</a> and for <a href="http://www.computerc.co.uk">Computer Care.</a>

I have samples of my work all over this site so feel free to look around. More things
will be added as I build, tinker and learn. If you want more work, or perhaps just
a higher resolution/different format of the work already presented please drop me
an e-mail and I will be happy to oblige. I'm also happy to discuss how I achieved
things from a technical standpoint with anybody who wants to know. I tend ramble
on at length on issues both personal and professional as I am a prolific writer,
so please visit my rants page to
check some of my writing out.

(PS: Iâ€™ve had a few requests for some video of me on Game Guru, so here is a video
of me in 2005 reviewing Perfect Dark Zero just after the launch of the Xbox 360.
Enjoy!)

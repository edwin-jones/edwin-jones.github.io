Here you can find details of some of the games I have worked on previously.

I helped write some tools for some of the vehicle animations alongside the artists on this title. I achieved this mostly with [Python.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) It was quite fun to play around with the artist's amazing work and the old style vehicles of the WW1 era.

On this game I worked with the UI team - primarily working on UI scripting with an in-house visual scripting language. I also made a few small tweaks to game code in [C++.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

### Battlefield Hardline (2015)

<br>

I helped to write several automation tests on this title for blackbox testing, via [C#.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) I helped build and install the automation test farm for [Visceral Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_Games) over in California. During this project I designed a small plugin for our in house telemetry website that logged which pages readers were looking at the most so we could prioritise development time more effectively.

### Need For Speed Rivals (2013)

<br>

I helped to write most of the automation tests on this title for blackbox testing via [C#.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) I worked on the transition of the testing platform over from Gen 3 consoles *(PS3, Xbox 360)* to Gen 4 *(PS4, Xbox One)*. I also helped to improve the GUI of the desktop version of the tool adding features such as tabs and console logs.

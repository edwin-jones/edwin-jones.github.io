I helped write some tools as well as editing some of the vehicle animations alongside the artists on this title. It
was quite fun to play around with their amazing work and the old style vehicles of the WW1 era.

### Need for Speed (2015)

On this game I worked with the UI team, primarily working on UI scripting and making a few tweaks to game code.

I helped to write several automation tests on this title for blackbox testing and helped build and install the automation test farm for [Visceral Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_Games) over in California.

<br>

I helped to write most of the automation tests on this title for blackbox testing. I also worked on the transition of the testing platform over from Gen 3 consoles *(PS3, Xbox 360)* to Gen 4 *(PS4, Xbox One)*.

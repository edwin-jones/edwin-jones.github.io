title: Games Boy - Write your own Game Boy games in C
---

The game boy was my first personal home console back in the early 90s and perhaps the console that cemented my 
love of games in general. I've always dreamed of writing a game for it 
and now it seems I (sort of) have.

I've been playing around with the [GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) for a while now and have managed to summarise my learnings in an article 
for Wireframe magazine. You can find the first part [here in issue 62](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.com/issues/62) and the second [here in issue 63.](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.com/issues/63) Both parts start on page 50 of their respective issues.

I'd like to add to the article with a little personal special thanks section. All these people and more helped me build 
what I hope is an interesting and informative read for you:

title:  Pi Bot
---


I've wanted to create a robot for a long time and with the help of the wonderful <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/beyond_scratch">Mr Andrew Brixey</a> 
I have finally been able to do so, for the <a href="http://www.thebigdraw.org/venue/Cranleigh_Arts_Centre/1407">Big Draw at Cranleigh Arts Centre</a> back in October.

The drawing robot was built with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3,</a> 
a basic frame, 2 motors, a <a href="http://www.sharpie.com/en-GB">Sharpie,</a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#DualShock_3">Playstation 3 controller,</a> 
<a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/explorer-hat">an explorer HAT,</a> 
a mobile phone power bank and some sticky tape. 
Thanks to the easy to use library provided by Tom Oinn for his <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/triangula/">Triangula</a> 
bot we managed to write the program that runs the robot in just <a href="https://gist.github.com/edwinj85/e1f1c5cd0117b0180143770a42cb7f53">30 lines of Python!</a>

All in all it was really easy to make the robot with pretty simple parts. The fact the Raspberry Pi 3 comes with bluetooth really puts it ahead of the other models for building robots. I'm really happy I managed to physically make something as well as code something. You can see the robot in action in the video below.

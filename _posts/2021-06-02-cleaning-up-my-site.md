title: Cleaning up my site
---

Since I started my own blog around 10 years ago to learn HTML and web tech in general, a lot has changed. I originally relied heavily on external tech such as [facebook comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/), [google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) and [disqus](https://disqus.com/) to host comments and track activity on my page. Sadly, things haven't exactly gone well in terms of privacy on the internet for a variety of reasons and I think it's time to clean this page up. 

Therefore as of right now this page is free of all trackers, social media widgets and ad tech I don't directly need to keep this site running. I'm still hosting on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [youtube](http://youtube.com) for video hosting and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) as a domain registrar so I can't guarantee this site is entirely tracker free but I'll endeavour to keep this page as clean as I can going forward.

Most of the web is full of pop ups, adverts and other annoyances that make the experience less pleasant than it could be. I can't fix those problems at scale but I can at least try to make people feel more at ease on my site. I hope in some small way this helps.

I'll work towards removing more trackers as and when I can find replacement tech. If you find something you think should be removed, please send me a message at <script type="text/javascript">printEmailAddress();</script>.
